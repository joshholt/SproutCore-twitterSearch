This is an attempt to create a twitter search application in SproutCore.
Eventually this will turn into a sweet Twitter application built on the extremely powerful SproutCore framework.

*** This is quick and dirty hack-y code ***
I plan to revisit this app in my spare time and do things proper.

Please feel free to fork this until it's done :)

*** The latest abbot and SC is required for this to work. (Build 1009) ***
