This is an attempt to create a twitter search application in SproutCore.
Eventually this will turn into a sweet Twitter application built on the extremely powerful SproutCore framework.

*** This is quick and dirty hack-y code ***
I plan to revisit this app in my spare time and do things proper.

Please feel free to fork this until it's done :)

*** The latest abbot and SC is required for this to work. (Build 1009) ***

If you want to statically build this app you will need to add this to your 
apache (VirtualHost) config. 

	{{{
		
		<VirtualHost *:80>
			ProxyRequests Off
			ProxyPass			/twitapp/search.json	http://search.twitter.com/search.json
			ProxyReversePass	/twitapp/search.json	http://search.twitter.com/search.json
		</VirtualHost>
	
	}}}
